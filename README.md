## Streaming Text Responses

AI models can be slow, especially when generating longer responses.
Users might be staring at a loading spinner for 5, 10 even 20 seconds which is not a great experience.

Instead of waiting for the entire response, we can start showing text as soon as the AI starts generting it

It's like the difference between downloading a movie completely before watching it vs streaming it on Youtube or Netflix

With streaming, the user sees progress immediately which makes the app feel much faster and more responsive.
